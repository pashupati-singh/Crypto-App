# Overview

CryptoStatus is a web application designed to help users stay informed about the latest developments in the cryptocurrency market. The website features a responsive design built with Tailwind CSS for styling. It utilizes Moment.js to display dates in a format of month and day. The website includes a navbar with a logo and the name of the website, followed by two types of tables:

Trending Cryptocurrencies: This table displays cryptocurrencies that are currently trending, providing users with insights into which coins are gaining traction among users. This data is fetched from the CoinGecko Trending API.

Market Values: This table shows the current market values of various cryptocurrencies, including prices, market capitalization, and trading volume. The data is fetched from the CoinGecko Market Values API.

Additionally, the website utilizes React-Chartjs-2 to display fluctuations in the price value of cryptocurrencies over the last 7 days, and it's all designed to adapt seamlessly to different screen sizes.
